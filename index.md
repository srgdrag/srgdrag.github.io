## Joshua Campbell's ePortfolio

# Self Assessment
  Having spent the last 4 years going through the computer science program at SNHU I’ve rediscovered my love for programing and software design in general. When I started the program, I had very little experience with program having only created a few basic programs but as I progressed, I learned how much I enjoy programming. From creating those original programs to some of the more complex ones like generating a 3D model my work throughout this program allowed me to hone my skills in all things programing giving me a better understanding of things like data structures. This also helped me work on some of the skills I lacked like working in a team environment and security both of which I had very little actual experience in. Although I have learned a lot throughout this program and know a lot more than when I started, I recognize that there are still places I need to improve on as well as more things I can learn. Overall, I believe that this portfolio adequately shows my current knowledge and ability to grow.
	 
 Each of these artifacts helps to show my knowledge and skills within certain fields. The software design artifact shows my skills in creation and designing a program. Having never used any of the OpenGL libraries before this I had to research how each function functioned and figure out how to incorporate each one into my program. The algorithm and data structures artifact shows my knowledge in creating and maintaining flexible data structures and using algorithms to get specific data from said structures. This artifact also helps to show my ability to adapt to prewritten code as parts of it were given to us with the hopes that we would finish it up. The database artifact showcases not only my ability handling a database but also my knowledge in multiple languages as this was developed in python. This artifact was both me learning how to program in python as well as learning a new database system with mongoDB as I had only previously worked with mySQL.

# Code Review

# Software Design and Engineering Artifact
## [Code](./SoftwareDesign.cpp) 

## Narrative
This artifact was created for my final project in CS 330 on August 4th of this year. This program uses OpenGL to render a 3D model of some kind of object with mine modeling a chair. I chose this project as I feel it adequately shows my skills in software design. Even though I was given the basis for some of the function most of the program is from my own knowledge and skill. Since it was a mostly complete program the enhancements for this is creating a menu to choose multiple different shapes to render. The biggest challenge I face with modifying this artifact was that I had forgotten how some of these functions interacted with each other. It had been a while since I did this program and as such had to relearn how some of the code actually worked. It was easier than it could have been since the comments were fairly thorough even if they could use some more. Other than that, this was a fairly easy program to modify.

# Algorithms and Data Structures Artifact
## [Code](./DataStructures.cpp)

## Narrative
This artifact comes from my CS 260 project in which we created a sort and search algorithm for a csv file. I included this into the portfolio as it shows my knowledge in algorithms as we were tasked with creating the sort and search algorithms used for the csv file. The specific components that show this are the class definitions and methods for each algorithm. I improved on this by adding more choices to search that use similar algorithms. Since this is what I planned for in the beginning there wasn’t any change in my outcome plans for this artifact. The biggest problem I came across for this artifact was remembering how csv files interacted with the program as that part was given to us as a skeleton and it had been a while since I used it. Overall though this was helpful in having me remember not only my algorithms but also how classes work.

# Databases Artifact
## [Code](./Database.py)

## Narrative
This artifact was done to allow access to MongoDB database from a separate client from the server. It was designed in two parts with a server API allowing the connection and the core code that would actually run the MongoDB commands. It was created for my CS340 class and I decided to include this into my portfolio because it shows my knowledge of python and shows that I have experience in server API commands. I have improved on this by adding more commands that can be sent to the server. This was mostly challenging just from trying to remember how to combine the MongoDB commands to get the results that I had wanted. I did however discover that I remembered a lot more of python than I had thought I did.
